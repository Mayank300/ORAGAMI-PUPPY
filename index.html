    <h1>HOW TO MAKE A PAPER PUPPY FACE</h1>
    <h2>The art of paper folding is known as origami. It's a great <br>
       inexpensive craft to make with children because all you need <br>
       is paper! This pattern is a good example of how you can take <br>
       most traditional origami models further to make them unique. <br>
       Add extra folds at the end or slightly adjust angles to <br>
       produce a different head or ear shapes.<br><br>

      The traditional origami dog face is usually made without <br>
      the nose, tongue, or lower jaw. If you had a paper that <br>
      is white on one side, though, you could easily draw on <br>
      the tongue and muzzle color. <br><br>
      
      You just need one sheet <br>
      of square paper for this. To start with, the suggested <br>
      paper size is at least 15 by 15 centimeters. The more <br>
      comfortable you get with origami, the smaller you can go.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;"  >  Start white side up. Place the paper in a diamond position.<br>
                                          Fold the top corner down to the bottom.<br>
                                          Fold the right corner over to the left.<br>
                                          Unfold one side.<br>

    <p></p>
    <p></p>


    <p style="text-align: center;" > Fold one corner down, leaving a small gap at the top of the middle crease.<br>
                                          Fold the other side down to match.<br>
                                       You can now fold the bottom corner up and behind. <br>
                                          You can finish here for the simplest origami dog face. <br>
                                          To make either the puppy's tongue or lower jaw, fold one<br>
                                           layer of the bottom up and continue to the next step.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >Fold the flap back down again to meet the bottom of the head.<br>
                                         Flip the model over to the other side.<br>
                                         Fold the lower flap down, leaving a small gap.<br>
                                          Fold the bottom corner up a tiny bit to round out the tongue and jaw.<br>
                                          If this is to be the jaw, it's finished. Continue to the next step if you're making a tongue.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;" > Fold the right corner of the lower section down as shown.<br>
                                       Unfold and use your finger to bring the flap out and over to the left.<br>
                                       Repeat on the left side.<br>
                                       This line is where the fold will be. Doesn't matter if it doesn't look neat.<br>
